# Memory Game

A simple and interactive **Memory Game** built with **React**. The goal is to find matching pairs of cards by flipping them one at a time. The game keeps track of the number of turns taken.

## Features
- **Card Flipping**: Flip the cards to reveal their front.
- **Card Matching**: Match pairs of cards. The cards stay flipped when they match.
- **Turn Counter**: Tracks the number of turns taken to match all pairs.
- **Shuffle Cards**: Cards are shuffled at the start of the game.
- **Responsive Design**: The game layout adapts to different screen sizes.

## Demo

## Technologies Used
- **React**: The game is built with React, using hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) to manage game state.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the game and creating a flip animation using CSS transitions.
- **JavaScript**: Used for logic handling, like shuffling the cards, comparing selections, etc.
